    'On this date I learned about Stateful components.',
    'In older versions of react only class components were considered as stateful components and functional components were stateless',
    'Afterwards when react hooks were introduced functional components can also be made stateful',
    'Hooks were added to React in version 16.8',
    'React hooks are functions used to make functional components stateful',
    'Prior to the introduction of hooks, stateful logic was mainly encapsulated in class components using the setState method. With hooks, functional components can now manage state and perform side effects, allowing for more concise and readable code.',
    'Previous Line was copied from ChatGPT 3.5 xD',
    'I also learned about export default today',
    'Only one component can be exported default in a file',
    'If one chooses not to export default than he has to import that component as its original identifier otherwise any identifier can be used while importing',
    'Happy coding. Thats all folks </>'
